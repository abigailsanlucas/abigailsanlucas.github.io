        <h2>How I Pulled a Muscle in My Forearm</h2>
        <p>I managed to strain a tendon in my forearm last week, 
            probably due to overuse while playing the 
            marimba-a percussion instrument. After 5 days, I 
            decided to schedule an appointment with Airrosti, a doctors 
            office I often go to for tendonitis.
        </p>

            Their treatment involves deep tissue manual therapy, 
            which is basically intense and targeted pressure to break 
            up scarred tissue in the muscle, which is not the most 
            relaxing massage. It's supposed to improve circulation, 
            accelerating the healing process.

        </p>
        <p>
            I've gone for two visits so far and am hoping to be 
            discharged by next Tuesday. In between appointments, I 
            ice to decrease the inflammation caused by the injury and the 
            deep tissue massages, while doing physical therapy to 
            stretch and strengthen the muscle. There's a performance 
            on Thursday that I'm hoping to be able to play at if I 
            heal fast enough, and typing this hurts, so I'm going to stop now.
